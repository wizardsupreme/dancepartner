No problem at all—thanks for clarifying! A Figma prototype is an excellent choice to ensure the freelancer aligns with your vision for the dance partner finder app before development begins. Using Figma allows you to create a clickable, high-fidelity design that you can review and approve, focusing on the key screens and interactions for dancers. This approach keeps costs low initially and ensures the UI/UX meets your expectations for features like Tinder-style swiping, Pro profiles, a TikTok-like timeline, and competition voting. We’ll stick with React Native for the final app (as per our earlier decision, with the option to switch to Flutter later if needed) and integrate it with Supabase. I’ll craft a revised Fiverr brief to incorporate the Figma prototype phase, outlining the process for design approval before coding. Let’s define the prototype scope and update the gig accordingly.

### Figma Prototype Plan
The Figma prototype will serve as a visual and interactive blueprint for the app, allowing you to validate the design with stakeholders (e.g., dance companies) before development. Flutter is no longer in focus for the prototype since you’ve specified Figma, and we’ll proceed with React Native for the final build. Here’s the scope:

#### **Prototype Scope**
- **Screens**:
  1. **Home/Swipe Screen**:
     - Tinder-like swiping interface with dancer profile cards (photo, name, dance style, skill level).
     - Buttons for "Like" and "Pass" with smooth animation feedback.
  2. **Profile Screen**:
     - Basic profile (name, photo, location) for free users.
     - Pro profile (portfolio with video/photo uploads, bio, partner-seeking toggle) with a clear upgrade button ($5–$15/month).
     - Option to link a custom domain (e.g., dancername.danceapp.com).
  3. **Timeline Screen**:
     - TikTok-style vertical video feed for non-partner-seeking dancers.
     - Like and comment buttons, with a ranking indicator.
  4. **Competition Screen**:
     - Voting poll for a dance competition (e.g., two dancers’ videos, vote button).
     - Placeholder for sponsor branding (to be expanded later).
- **Interactions**:
  - Clickable swipes (left/pass, right/like).
  - Toggle switch for partner-seeking status.
  - Video playback simulation (static placeholders).
  - Vote button with confirmation popup.
- **Design Goals**:
  - Dance-themed aesthetics (e.g., vibrant colors, dance icons).
  - Intuitive navigation for dancers and companies.
  - Mobile-first (iOS 11+, Android 5.0+ compatibility).
- **Deliverables**:
  - Figma file with all screens and interactions.
  - Shareable prototype link for review.
  - 1–2 revision rounds based on your feedback.

#### **Timeline and Cost**:
- **Time**: 1–2 weeks (designer availability permitting).
- **Fiverr Cost**: $50–$150 (mid-tier designer with mobile app experience).
- **Approval**: You review and approve the prototype by early June 2025 (e.g., June 1–5), allowing 2–3 weeks for development to start.

#### **Why Figma First?**
- Ensures alignment on UI/UX before coding, reducing rework.
- Allows pitching to dance companies for early feedback or partnerships.
- Keeps initial costs low ($50–$150) compared to jumping straight into development ($150–$400).

### Updated Fiverr Gig Brief
Here’s a revised brief incorporating the Figma prototype phase. It separates the design and development tasks, inviting bids from designers first, followed by developers once the prototype is approved.

**Title**: Design and Develop a React Native Dance Partner Finder App with Figma Prototype

**Description**:
I’m building a mobile app (iOS and Android) for a dance partner finder, combining Tinder-like swiping with a TikTok-style timeline, using Supabase for the backend. I need a two-phase approach:
- **Phase 1: Figma Prototype**:
  - Create a clickable prototype with:
    - Home/Swipe Screen (Tinder-like swiping with dancer profiles: photo, name, style, skill, locations).
    - Profile Screen (basic + Pro tier with portfolio, bio, partner-seeking toggle, domain linking option).
    - Timeline Screen (vertical video feed with likes/ranking).
    - Chat Screen
    - Likes Screen (to see who liked me, similar functionalities as tinder)
    - search configuration screen (to put in and tune filters)
  - Include dance-themed design (vibrant colors, icons) and mobile-first layout.
  - Deliverables: Figma file, shareable prototype link, 4-5 revision rounds.
  - Timeline: 5-7 days.
- **Phase 2: React Native Development** (after prototype approval):
  - Build the app using React Native, integrated with Supabase (database, Auth, Edge Functions).
  - Features: Swiping, profiles (basic + Pro with video/photo uploads), real-time chat with matches, timeline.
  - Deliverables: Fully functional app, Supabase SDK integration, 5–10 Edge Functions (e.g., /profiles, /uploadPortfolio, /vote), source code, documentation, testing.
  - Timeline: 10-14 days post-prototype approval.

**Requirements**:
- **Phase 1**: Experience with Figma, mobile app design, and interactive prototypes.
- **Phase 2**: Experience with React Native, TypeScript, and Supabase.
- Ability to adapt open-source projects (e.g., recent Tinder clones) is a plus.
- Budget: $50–$150 (Phase 1), $150–$400 (Phase 2); open to quotes.
- Please bid for Phase 1 first, with an optional Phase 2 proposal.
